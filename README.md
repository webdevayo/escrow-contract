# Milestone Escrow Contract

A Soroban smart contract on Stellar that enables trustless milestone-based escrow between a client, freelancer, and arbiter.

## Overview

This contract allows a client to fund a job broken into milestones. Funds are locked in the contract and released per milestone only when the client approves delivery. Disputes can be raised by either party and resolved by a designated arbiter.

## Contract Functions

|---|---|---|
| `initialize` | Anyone | Set up job with parties, token, and milestone amounts |
| `fund` | Client | Deposit total amount into contract |
| `mark_delivered` | Freelancer | Mark a milestone as delivered |
| `approve_milestone` | Client | Release funds for a delivered milestone |
| `raise_dispute` | Client or Freelancer | Freeze a milestone for arbitration |
| `resolve_dispute` | Arbiter | Release to freelancer or refund to client |
